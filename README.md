🏦 Digital Banking: Payment & Credit Risk Analytics
Strategic Insights for KAF Group Digital Bank
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce payment behaviors to derive actionable business recommendations for digital banking products. By leveraging PySpark and SQL, I have modeled transaction data to identify customer segments for credit products and installment-based financial services.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Big Data Framework: PySpark

Data Manipulation: SQL (Joins, Window Functions, Aggregations)

Visualization: Matplotlib (Alternative to Tableau/Power BI for high-performance reporting)

📊 Banking Strategy: Key Insights
This analysis addresses the core responsibilities of the Data Analytics Intern role:

Installment Behavior Analysis: Segmented customers based on installment counts to identify potential loan applicants.

Credit Volume Calculation: Aggregated total payment values to visualize the bank's potential transaction volume across different payment methods.

Operational Optimization: Provided insights into high-installment risks, helping the "Digital Bank" team prioritize financial stability.

📈 Visualized Recommendations
Instead of basic tables, I utilize automated Python scripts to generate insightful dashboards.
